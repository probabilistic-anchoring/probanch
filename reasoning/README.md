# The reasoning package #
Make sure you got the [Distributional Clauses](https://bitbucket.org/problog/dc_problog/src/master/) installed on your machine and also YAP (Yet another Prolog). Make sure, when installing YAP, that you follow the instructions on the Distributional Clauses repository page.

You also need to install the [PyDC](https://github.com/ML-KULeuven/PyDC) python package that wraps around Distributional Clauses.
